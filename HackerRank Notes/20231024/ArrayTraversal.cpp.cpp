/*
Akash got a new coin game. In the coin game, Akash will only win the game if the total count is 56. Each coin will have value inscribed. Write a programming solution, to help Akash in counting total value of coins at the end of the game. Coin Game is played N times.

Note: Player will have exactly K coins at the end of the game.
Input Format

1st line contain N(integers) 2nd line contain space separated values from K coins

Constraints

N>0 & N<=5
K=7
Output Format

One integer â€“ 1 in case of win, 0 in case of loss

Sample Input 0
